# SINCAL acquisition and corpus evidence

This branch supplies model-neutral SQLite/archive acquisition and schema
validation. The balanced reader branch additionally maps the complete small SimBench case
through the explicit `sincal-balanced` public parser profile. Acquisition-only reports
remain distinct from electrical reader validation; none establishes fresh
writer acceptance. The [delivery plan](../../docs/design/pss-sincal.md) records the
five local PR scopes and dataset targets. The [research catalog](research-catalog.md)
records prior inspections and data rights; its deeper electrical investigations
belong to the reader branches and are not all implemented in this branch.

Run the small licensed archive and paired SimBench evidence checks with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s evals/sincal -v
python3 evals/sincal/inspect_native.py tests/data/sincal/1-LV-rural1--0-sw.sinx
cargo test -p powerio-sincal
```

The fixture's provenance and ODbL/DbCL notices live in
[tests/data/sincal](../../tests/data/sincal/README.md). The 88,876-byte archive
is unmodified; its larger unpacked database is not vendored. Original synthetic
unit tests exercise malformed inputs without copying additional native models.

The [CSIRO inventory](csiro-inventory.json) contains hashes, counts and raw
observations for 19 external CC BY 4.0 databases. It contains no model payloads.
Access acquisition is explicit and optional, as described below. These
historical counts are all stored rows, not effective selected-variant sizes.
External corpora remain outside the repository, and a source-code license
alone does not establish model redistribution rights.

## Explicit Access acquisition

Install MDB Tools separately and invoke the adapter explicitly; ordinary Rust
library parsing does not launch it. Python 3.11+ and MDB Tools 1.0.1 were tested
on macOS. Other tool releases/platforms require their own verification.

```sh
python3 evals/sincal/import_access.py /external/database.mdb /tmp/records.json \
  --tool-directory /path/to/mdbtools/bin
cargo run -p powerio-sincal --example inspect_records -- /tmp/records.json 1
```

The helper copies the original into private temporary storage, hashes that
snapshot, and collects declared columns plus typed JSON rows. It restores
omitted NULLs from schema declarations without treating missing columns as
NULL or text zero as a number. No exported SQL is executed. By default it
acquires 21 requested input/profile tables where present; use repeated
`--table` arguments to choose another explicit set. It lists excluded tables
and absent requested tables separately. Blob/object cells and unknown schema
declaration syntax fail explicitly. An electrical mapper must request every
table its active input modes require; successful structural decoding alone
cannot justify omitting a referenced type/library table.

Limits are 256 MiB original input, 64 MiB record/tool output, 1 MiB per text
field, 100,000 rows per table, four million acquired cells and bounded tool
runtime. Original MDB bytes remain external; record documents are internal
acquisition artifacts, not native SQLite exports or lossless MDB archives.
The tool never overwrites a destination or emits partial output on validation
failure. Keep the original MDB for native source echo and provenance.

Reproduce all 19 required corpus cases, with a fresh external record directory:

```sh
cargo build -p powerio-sincal --example inspect_records
python3 evals/sincal/check_access_corpus.py /external/csiro \
  /tmp/sincal-acquired /tmp/sincal-acquisition-report.json \
  --inspector target/debug/examples/inspect_records \
  --tool-directory /path/to/mdbtools/bin
```

The source directory can contain the publisher's `DataRelease/...` layout or
the research filenames `csiro-representative01.mdb` through `...19.mdb`.
Missing cases, changed source hashes, mismatched counts or Rust inspection
failures fail the run. The checks compare acquired row counts with the pinned
inventory, then compare Rust's selected-variant identities with independently
selected records. The [acquisition report](access-acquisition.json) records all 19 passing
base-variant snapshots; derived variants and
electrical mappings remain outside this claim. On this macOS run the maximum
Rust inspector child RSS across the 19 cases was about 80.2 MB. Memory and
execution time are observations for this corpus, not portability guarantees.

## Balanced reader: first complete authentic case

The Rust `sincal_balanced` example explicitly selects positive sequence and
exports the actual typed reader output for validation. It is not automatic
family detection. The facade accepts the same case with the explicit
`sincal-balanced` format argument; see [the user guide](../../docs/src/sincal.md). The current schema adapter accepts
14.8 and maps all 32 equipment records of the licensed 15-node SimBench case.
Unknown active modes fail with native table, record and field context.

```sh
cargo test -p powerio-tx --lib format::sincal
cargo build -p powerio-tx --example sincal_balanced
python evals/sincal/check_balanced_simbench.py target/debug/examples/sincal_balanced /tmp/simbench-check.json
```

The independent check requires `numpy` and `pandapower==3.2.2`. It compares
Rust network parameters with the original CSV files, constructs a pandapower
network solely from those CSV inputs, and compares a fresh pi-transformer
load-flow solution with independently solved nodal equations for the mapped
network. Stored rounded CSV results are reported separately and never supply
input physics. Temporary derived cases additionally test nonzero fixed taps
on each winding against independently configured pandapower transformers.
See [the recorded report](balanced-simbench.json).

The mapper uses a declared 100 MVA conversion base, native bus IDs and stable
element identities. Open terminals become explicit switches on auxiliary buses;
inactive equipment is retained. Absent generator capability limits remain
unbounded, rather than becoming zero capability. Fault impedance and historical
result tables do not affect load-flow mapping. Voltage-dependent loads are
normalized to demand at the nominal bus voltage.

Still required for the complete transmission PR: additional SimBench modes
and corpus cases, verified Access/other-schema adapters, profile/variant
selection and expanded public input options. Registered diagnostics,
facade/CLI/C/Python parsing, retained binary-source echo, edited-module refusal
and IR-without-native-source behavior now have focused integration tests. This first mapped case does not establish
those capabilities, unbalanced reading, or native SINCAL writer acceptance.
