# PowerWorld formats in powerio

Working notes for the PowerWorld interchange path: what a real complete case
export contains, where the original reader fell short, and the evidence behind
the `.pwb` binary decoding. Fixture provenance is in
`tests/data/powerworld/README.md`.

## The aux grammar (from the official guide)

Source: "Auxiliary File Format for Simulator 24", PowerWorld Corporation,
November 6, 2025 (powerworld.com). The grammar below is what the guide
specifies; Simulator 19+ writes either form.

Legacy header:

```text
DATA DataName(object_type, [list_of_fields], file_type_specifier, create_if_not_found)
{
value_list_1
...
}
```

- `DataName` is optional.
- `file_type_specifier`: blank, `AUXDEF`, or `DEF` mean space delimited
  values; `AUXCSV`, `CSV`, or `CSVAUX` mean comma delimited.
- `create_if_not_found`: `YES`, `NO`, or `PROMPT`; optional, default `YES`.

Concise header (Simulator 19+ default): `object_type DataName(list_of_fields)`
with no `DATA` keyword and no square brackets. Concise data is always space
delimited.

Rules shared by both forms:

- The field list may span several lines. Fields are comma separated. A `//`
  comment anywhere in a line discards the rest of the line; blank lines are
  ignored.
- A value list row may span several lines; each new object starts on its own
  line, so a row is complete when it has one value per declared field.
- Strings quote with `"` and must quote when they contain spaces or commas.
  Empty quoted strings are valid values.
- Field names carry location suffixes, `variablename:location` (`BusNum:1` is
  the second bus of a branch); `:0` may be omitted. Simulator 19 renamed most
  located fields to concise names (`LineMW:1` became `MWTo`), and both
  generations of names appear in the wild.
- `<SUBDATA subobject_type> ... </SUBDATA>` blocks follow the value row of
  the object they belong to, inside the `{ }` body. Their interior format is
  fixed per subobject type; some hold free text (`PWCaseHeader`), some hold
  per line records (`CTGElement`, `LimitViol`, ...).
- Values may be special references (`"@field:loc:digits:decimals"`,
  `"&Objecttype 'keys' field"`); they are strings at the grammar level.

## Gap list: the reader before this work vs ACTIVSg200.aux

Baseline measured 2026-06-10 against the vendored fixture (Simulator 20
export, legacy headers, 22 DATA blocks over 21 object types). The reader
accepted the file and produced a 200 bus Network with no warnings, and the
result was wrong everywhere it could be:

1. **Multiline field lists truncated.** The parser required the whole
   `DATA (Object, [fields])` header on one line. 14 of the 22 blocks in the
   real export wrap their field lists (Bus declares 36 fields over 6 lines,
   Gen 62 over 10, Branch 55 and 76, Load 25, Shunt 23). Only the fields on
   the header's first line were mapped; every later field silently defaulted.
   Measured damage: all 246 branches parsed with R = X = 0 (the impedance
   fields sit past line one), every bus came back PQ (BusCat unread; the
   sibling case has 48 PV, 1 slack), vmax/vmin/area/zone all defaulted.
2. **ZIP load components unread.** The export carries no `LoadMW`; it writes
   `LoadSMW/LoadSMVR/LoadIMW/LoadIMVR/LoadZMW/LoadZMVR`. The reader looked up
   `LoadMW`, found nothing, and emitted 160 loads of 0 MW.
3. **Two Branch blocks conflated.** Lines (180 rows, 55 fields) and
   transformers (66 rows, 76 fields with tap/regulation data) are separate
   blocks; both were fed through one field mapping keyed to the writer's own
   13 field layout.
4. **16 of 21 object types dropped on the floor**: PWCaseInformation, Owner,
   Substation, Limit_Monitoring_Options_Value, LimitSet, RatingSetNameBus,
   RatingSetNameBranch, RatingSetNameInterface, Area, Zone,
   BalancingAuthority, Sim_Solution_Options_Value, PostPowerFlowActions,
   GICXFormer, Contingency, ContingencyElement. No retention, no warning.
   Contingency data (245 contingencies with 490 SUBDATA blocks) is the
   payload a transmission study cares about.
5. **SUBDATA unparsed.** `<SUBDATA>` tags inside a mapped block would have
   been read as value rows. The baseline file only carries SUBDATA in
   unmapped blocks (PWCaseInformation, Contingency), which is why the parse
   did not error.
6. **Comments unhandled.** `//` comments inside field lists or bodies were
   not stripped (the real file has them inside SUBDATA).
7. **Concise headers, CSV delimiting, DataName, create_if_not_found,
   SCRIPT sections, multiline value rows: unsupported.** None appear in the
   ACTIVSg exports, all are legal aux per the format guide.
8. **No structural fidelity.** Echoing back the same format relied entirely
   on the retained source; converting aux to aux through the typed model
   reduced 21 object types to the writer's 5.

Counts that survived the baseline: 200 buses, 49 generators, 160 loads,
4 shunts, 246 branches (180 + 66). The sibling `case_ACTIVSg200.m` carries
245 branches; reconciling the difference is part of the parity work.

## Mapping notes (established against the sibling exports)

- Complete case exports spread one object type over several DATA sections
  with complementary field groups (the 2016 Texas2000 export writes Bus
  twice, Gen three times, and a separate `Transformer` object for regulation
  fields). The reader merges sections by key fields: BusNum for buses,
  BusNum + device ID for loads/gens/shunts, bus pair + circuit for branches.
  `Transformer` sections only augment existing branches.
- Transformer records in Simulator 20 era exports carry impedance and tap
  under `:1` locations (`LineR:1`, `LineTap:1`); 2016 era exports use the
  bare names for everything. `LineTap` equals the MATPOWER tap convention
  (verified on all 66 ACTIVSg200 and 562 Texas2000 transformers).
- Loads are ZIP components (`LoadSMW/LoadIMW/LoadZMW`, ...). The typed model
  carries the sum at nominal voltage; nonzero I/Z components are kept in
  extras under their PowerWorld field names.
- PowerWorld stores no PV/PQ type: `BusSlack` marks the reference and PV is
  derived from in service generators. `BusVoltLim` is a YES/NO monitoring
  toggle, never a number; per rating set limits live in
  `BusVoltLimHigh:n`/`BusVoltLimLow:n` (empty in the ACTIVSg exports).
- Branch identity (circuit ID, device type) and substation coordinates ride
  in element extras under PowerWorld field names (`LineCircuit`,
  `BranchDeviceType`, `Latitude:1`, ...), so the aux writer reproduces them
  and cross format writers report them as extras.
- Generator has no extras map (a deliberate performance decision), so GenID
  and regulation fields are reachable only through the generic layer.
- Aux exports print f32 noise in some fields (`BusNomVolt`
  13.800000190734863); parity compares are approximate accordingly.

## Parity findings (vendored ACTIVSg200 set)

The vendored siblings are different case revisions: `.aux`/`.pwb` are a June
2018 pair, `case_ACTIVSg200.m` is October 2017, `.RAW` is May 2017. Identity
and impedance data agree (impedances to 5e-6, all 66 taps exact); the 2018
revision adds one line (82-64) absent from 2017, and the solved states and
load values differ between revisions. The June 2016 ACTIVSg2000 sibling set
(fetched) was exported in one day from one case and gives full value parity:
vm/va to 1e-6/1e-4, ZIP load totals vs MATPOWER Pd/Qd to the .m print
quantum, dispatch and branch values likewise. `powerio/tests/`
`powerworld_parity.rs` asserts all of this.
