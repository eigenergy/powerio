# Matrix outputs and conventions

The `powerio-matrix` crate builds sparse matrices and graph outputs for common power system representations. The outputs are derived from a parsed `Network`. The builders take the densely indexed `IndexedNetwork`, which maps bus ids to a
contiguous `[0, n)`.

**Note:** The experimental DC OPF bundle currently has its own schema in [dcopf-bundle.md](dcopf-bundle.md), and per-builder API
detail is in the [crate docs](https://eigenergy.github.io/powerio/powerio_matrix/).

## Current capabilities

| matrix | shape | builder | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B' (FDPF) | n×n | `build_bprime` | singular positive Laplacian, rank n−1, shuntless |
| B'' (FDPF) | n×n | `build_bdoubleprime` | SDDM when bus shunts are present |
| `Re(Y_bus)`, `-Im(Y_bus)` | n×n | `build_ybus` | full admittance, keeps taps and shifts |
| LACPF (linear AC power flow) block | 2n×2n | `build_lacpf` | `[[G, −B], [−B, −G]]`, flat start, indefinite |
| signed incidence `A` | n×m | `build_incidence` | column `e`: `+1` at from-bus, `−1` at to-bus |
| weighted Laplacian `L` | n×n | `build_weighted_laplacian` | `L = A diag(w) Aᵀ`, `ground_at` removes a row/col |
| flow map `B Aᵀ` | m×n | `build_flow_map` | `f = B Aᵀ θ` |
| PTDF | m×n | `build_ptdf` | dense; factors the Laplacian grounded at the reference buses |
| LODF | m×m | `build_lodf` | dense DC line-outage factors |
| adjacency | n×n | `build_adjacency` | `MatrixKind::Adjacency` |
| petgraph graph | n/a | `IndexedNetwork::to_petgraph` | `UnGraph<bus_idx, branch_idx>` |

Computing PTDF and LODF matrices requires a linear solve, which is not the focus of powerio. Both factor the Laplacian with one row and column removed for each reference bus, using the dense Cholesky in
`matrix::sensitivity`. Every connected component must contain at least one
reference bus. PTDF is dense `m×n`. The DC OPF
instance bundle (`A`, `b`, `L`, costs, bounds, thermal limits, `C_g`) is documented in
[dcopf-bundle.md](dcopf-bundle.md).

## Conventions

- **Positive Laplacian matrices.** Off-diagonal `< 0`, diagonal `> 0`, with `diag = Σ|off-diag|`
  for B' susceptance matrices. This is the M-matrix form an SDDM (symmetric diagonally dominant
  M-matrix) or Cholesky solver expects; a consumer can recover an edge weight as `−L[i,j] > 0`.
- **Bus indexing.** Bus ids are 1-based and preserved on the model as a newtype
  (the Rust [New Type Idiom](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html)).
  `IndexedNetwork::bus_index(id)` is the only mapping into the dense `[0, n)`; an id
  out of range is an `Error::UnknownBus`.
- **Taps and shifts.** `tap == 0` means `tap = 1` (`Branch::effective_tap`). B'
  ignores taps and shifts; B'' keeps taps and zeros only shifts; Y_bus keeps both.
- **Line charging susceptance is stored per unit.** `Branch::b` is the total
  charging susceptance, already per unit on the system base (the MATPOWER `BR_B`
  convention, which the other readers normalize to). The builders use it as
  stored, with no further scaling.
- **B' scheme.** `Scheme` selects between the two fast decoupled load flow
  variants for B': `Xb` weights a branch by `1/x` (series resistance ignored),
  `Bx` (the default) by `x/(r² + x²)`.
- **Zero impedance branches.** B' skips them by default
  (`BuildOptions::skip_zero_impedance`; set it `false` to get
  `Error::ZeroImpedance`). Y_bus scatters no admittance for them (`r² + x² = 0`)
  and the incidence builder drops them, both unconditionally. The gridfm export
  counts the drops (`dropped_zero_impedance` in `gridfm_meta.json`).
- **Reference coverage.** `IndexedNetwork::check_reference_coverage` verifies that
  every in-service island has a reference bus.
- **Susceptance conventions for the DC approximation.** `DcConvention` selects
  the branch weight the DC builders (incidence, weighted Laplacian, PTDF/LODF,
  the DC OPF bundle) use. The default `PaperPure` is the textbook DC power flow
  weight `b = 1/x`, taps and shifts ignored; the resulting `L = A diag(b) Aᵀ`
  equals B' under `Scheme::Xb`. `Matpower` reproduces MATPOWER's `makeBdc`:
  `b = 1/(x·τ)` for a transformer with tap ratio `τ`, plus the phase shift
  injection vector `p_shift`.

## Output

Matrices write as Matrix Market files or stay in memory. A symmetric matrix is
stored as its lower triangle with the `symmetric` header and 1-based indices
(`io::mtx::write_mtx`). The `sensitivities` and `dcopf` CLI subcommands bundle
the relevant family with a JSON manifest.

`IndexedNetwork::to_petgraph` returns the network as an undirected
[petgraph](https://docs.rs/petgraph) graph, one node per bus and one edge per
in-service branch. The connectivity report and the radial check are built on
it, and it is the entry point for any other graph algorithm petgraph provides.
